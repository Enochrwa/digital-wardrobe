CHAPTER1: GENERAL INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background of the study
Fashion and wardrobes management have always been integral as pets of daily life. With the increasing pace of modern living, people often struggle to organize their clothes select suitable outfits for various occasions, and keep track of what they own. Traditional methods of   managing wardrobes like keeping physical record or simply relying on memory are inefficient and phone error. (Choo et al., 2014)  
In today's   digital era, technological solutions are transforming how individuals approach routine task. Digital wardrobe management system are emerging as a practical and efficient way to streamline clothing organization, outfit planning and fashion sharing. These application leverage cloud storage, machine learning, and mobile technologies to help users manage their wardrobes collection. Reduce decision making time, and even embrace sustainable fashion practices by tracking clothing usage. 
This study focuses on the development on intuitive mobile and wabe-based application for wardrobe management. The solution aims to allow users to catalog clothing, plan outfits, and receive AI-powered style recommendations. By incorporating social features, users can share outfits ideas and engage with a fashion- minded community, making the process both productive and interactive. Furthermore, with environmental sustainability becoming a global priority, the proposed application can encourage mindful fashion choices by providing analytics on underused clothing items and promoting sustainable clothing practices. The implementation of features such as smart outfit suggestions based on weather and events, virtual outfit previews, and planning tools makes this project highly relevant in today's digital land scope. The application addresses the growing need for convenience, personalization, and sustainable wardrobe management, offering a sophisticated yet user-friendly solution.

1.2. Problem Statement
In daily life, people, often face challenges when deciding what  clothes to wear for event,school,or when at home,wedding.the lack of an easy and sufficient way to select suitable outfits leads to time time-consuming decision making and sometimes poor clothing choices.Additionally there are situations where someone may own a specific clothing item, such as a skirt, but struggle to find a matching blouse or other complementary attire. This often results in frustration or wearing outfits that do not match well, many people wish for a technology-driven solution that helps them quickly  and easily find matching clothes.(Akram et al., 2022)
Traditional methods, such as relying on personal judgment or seeking advice from friends, are inadequate. There is no comprehensive platform where individuals can get reliable fashion recommendations tailored to weather conditions, event types, or casual home wear. This project aims to address these issues by developing a mobile and web-based application that will help users.
i. Select appropriate outfits for different occasions and casual wear at home.
ii. Identify complementary clothing item (such as finding a blouse that matches a specific skirt).
iii. Receive smart recommendation based on events or weather conditions.
Therefore, this project aims develop a mobile and web application that addresses these issues by providing a platform for users to catalog clothing, plan outfits, receive AI-based style recommendations, and connect with a fashion-focused community. The solution will promote efficient wardrobe usage, support sustainable fashion practices and enhance user convenience through smart technologies.

1.9. Research methodology
In the research methodology for the digital wardrobe management system, the initial phase involved observation, where user behavior related to clothing organization,oiutfits selection, and fashion preferences was studied in real-life scenarios. On-sites and visits and informal user interactions were conducted to gain insight into how individuals plan their daily outfits and manage their wardrobes manually. Documentation technique were employed to symmetrically record user habits,preferences,and pain points associated with managing clothing for different occasions. For data collection, information was gathered from a variety of sources, including fashion enthusiasts, everyday users, and online fashion communities. This data includes user wardrobes habits, style preferences, event-based outfits choices, and common wardrobe challenges, which will later support personalization and intelligent matching features within the app.To implement the project I used different language HTML,CSS and Java Scripts for building the front-end of the web and mobile interfaces, ensuring responsive and visually appealing user experience. On the back-end ,I use Python, PHP,MYSQL,and xampp were employed to manage server side logic, user account and  secure data storage. The development and testing were conducted on window 10 platforms , and the application is designed to operate on systems running the Windows Operating System. This technical stack provides a reliable environment for development, with flexibility for future scalability and deployment across both mobile and web platforms. By combining qualitative observations and structured data collection with practical implementation, the methodology ensures the app is user-centered and functionally robust. Continuous feedback and iterative development will further refine the application based on real-world usage.
