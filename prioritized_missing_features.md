## Prioritized List of Missing or Partially Implemented Features

1.  **Feature:** Users can upload images of their clothing items.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Frontend: `AddItemModal.tsx` likely supports this, but not explicitly stated for images. Backend: `wardrobe.py` would need to handle image storage/references)
    *   **Justification (Priority 1 - Core Functionality):** A visual catalog is fundamental for a digital wardrobe. Users need to see their clothes. Full implementation of image handling is crucial.

2.  **Feature:** Users can search for specific items within their digital wardrobe.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Frontend: `WardrobeManager.tsx` likely includes search functionality, but not a dedicated component)
    *   **Justification (Priority 1 - Core Functionality):** Essential for usability, especially as the wardrobe grows. Robust search makes the app practical.

3.  **Feature:** The system assists users in finding matching clothing items (e.g., pairing a blouse with a specific skirt).
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py` or `recommendations.py`, Frontend: `OutfitGenerator.tsx`, `AIOutfitAnalyzer.tsx` - could be AI-driven or simpler logic)
    *   **Justification (Priority 1 - Core Functionality):** This is a primary value proposition for outfit planning. Ensuring this works well, whether through simple rules or AI, is key.

4.  **Feature:** The system stores user preferences.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Backend: `auth.py` or dedicated user profile table, Frontend: `UserProfile.tsx` - depth of preferences unclear)
    *   **Justification (Priority 1 - Core Functionality):** Personalization is central to the app's experience. Comprehensive preference storage is needed for effective recommendations and a tailored feel.

5.  **Feature:** Data privacy and security measures are implemented to protect user data.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Backend: `auth.py` for authentication is a start; full scope of data security is broad)
    *   **Justification (Priority 1 - Core Functionality):** Absolutely critical for user trust and legal compliance. Needs thorough implementation beyond basic authentication.

6.  **Feature:** The app complies with relevant data protection regulations and standards.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Depends on implementation details beyond component list, e.g., how data is stored, consent mechanisms)
    *   **Justification (Priority 1 - Core Functionality):** A non-negotiable aspect. Must be fully addressed.

7.  **Feature:** Recommendations are tailored to user's personal style preferences.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py`, `style_history.py`, Frontend: `AIStyleInsights.tsx` - depends on depth of preference tracking)
    *   **Justification (Priority 2 - AI Features):** Enhances the core value of AI recommendations. Deepening the personalization significantly improves user satisfaction.

8.  **Feature:** Recommendations consider weather conditions.
    *   **Status:** Not Implemented (No specific component or router listed for weather integration)
    *   **Justification (Priority 2 - AI Features):** A highly practical AI feature that adds significant daily value to outfit recommendations.

9.  **Feature:** Users can create virtual outfit previews.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Frontend: `WardrobePreview.tsx` - extent of "virtual preview" is unclear, could be simple image composition)
    *   **Justification (Priority 3 - User Engagement):** Improves the outfit planning experience by allowing users to visualize their choices. Clarifying and enhancing this is important.

10. **Feature:** Users can receive feedback on shared outfits.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Frontend: `CommunityFeed.tsx` likely supports this. Backend: Needs mechanism to store/retrieve feedback, possibly linked to outfits or a community model)
    *   **Justification (Priority 3 - User Engagement):** Key to making community features interactive and valuable. Requires backend support for storing and managing feedback.

11. **Feature:** Users who share outfit ideas with friends are more likely to become frequent app users (Hypothesis to be validated by feature, implies sharing with friends).
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Frontend: `CommunityHub.tsx` might have friend-sharing options, but not explicit)
    *   **Justification (Priority 3 - User Engagement):** Social sharing is a driver for growth and engagement. Explicit "share with friends" functionality should be confirmed/implemented.

12. **Feature:** Receiving feedback on shared outfits will increase user engagement and satisfaction (Hypothesis to be validated by feature).
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Covered by feedback feature above)
    *   **Justification (Priority 3 - User Engagement):** This is an outcome of the feedback feature, so its priority is linked.

13. **Feature:** The system allows virtual try-ons (mentioned as a potential AR feature to explore).
    *   **Status:** Not Implemented (`WardrobePreview.tsx` is likely simpler than AR try-on)
    *   **Justification (Priority 3 - User Engagement):** A high-impact, advanced feature that could significantly differentiate the app and boost engagement if implemented effectively.

14. **Feature:** The system provides notifications reminding users of planned outfits.
    *   **Status:** Not Implemented (No specific components for notifications listed)
    *   **Justification (Priority 3 - User Engagement):** Helps keep users engaged with the app and their planned activities, improving retention.

15. **Feature:** The system implements gamification elements (e.g., badges for creative outfit combinations) to increase user engagement (Hypothesis, implies feature).
    *   **Status:** Not Implemented
    *   **Justification (Priority 3 - User Engagement):** Can make the app more fun and encourage deeper interaction with its features.

16. **Feature:** The system encourages mindful fashion choices.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Partially through `WardrobeStats.tsx` and `AIStyleInsights.tsx` - indirect encouragement)
    *   **Justification (Priority 4 - Sustainability):** An important ethical goal. Can be enhanced by making sustainability insights more direct and actionable.

17. **Feature:** The system promotes sustainable clothing practices.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Partially through analytics and insights - indirect promotion)
    *   **Justification (Priority 4 - Sustainability):** Similar to the above; making these aspects more explicit can increase impact.

18. **Feature:** The system allows for real-time updates to clothing organization.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (General expectation of a modern frontend with a backend; specific websocket/push mechanism not detailed)
    *   **Justification (Priority 5 - Technical/General):** Important for a smooth user experience, but likely a refinement rather than a missing core piece if basic updates work.

19. **Feature:** The application is an intuitive and user-friendly mobile and web-based application.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Subjective; assumed goal of listed UI components and general structure)
    *   **Justification (Priority 5 - Technical/General):** This is an overarching quality goal, addressed continuously through UI/UX improvements rather than a single feature implementation.

20. **Feature:** The system includes an intuitive interface and seamless navigation.
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented (Subjective; assumed goal of listed UI components)
    *   **Justification (Priority 5 - Technical/General):** Similar to the above; ongoing effort.
