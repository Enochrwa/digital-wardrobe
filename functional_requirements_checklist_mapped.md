## Digital Wardrobe App - Functional Requirements Checklist

### Wardrobe Organization
- [x] Users can catalog their clothing items. (Backend: `wardrobe.py`, Frontend: `WardrobeManager.tsx`, `AddItemModal.tsx`)
- [p] Users can upload images of their clothing items. (Frontend: `AddItemModal.tsx` likely supports this, but not explicitly stated for images. Backend: `wardrobe.py` would need to handle image storage/references)
- [x] Users can categorize clothing items (e.g., by type, color, season, style). (Backend: `wardrobe.py`, Frontend: `AddItemModal.tsx`, `WardrobeManager.tsx`)
- [x] The system provides an intuitive interface for browsing and managing the digital wardrobe. (Frontend: `WardrobeManager.tsx`, various `ui/*.tsx` components)
- [p] The system allows for real-time updates to clothing organization. (General expectation of a modern frontend with a backend; specific websocket/push mechanism not detailed)
- [p] Users can search for specific items within their digital wardrobe. (Frontend: `WardrobeManager.tsx` likely includes search functionality, but not a dedicated component)

### Outfit Planning
- [x] Users can mix and match clothing items to create outfits. (Backend: `outfits.py`, Frontend: `CreateOutfitModal.tsx`, `OutfitGenerator.tsx`)
- [x] Users can plan outfits for various occasions (e.g., weddings, church, casual outings, home wear, formal events). (Backend: `occasions.py`, `outfits.py`, Frontend: `OccasionPlanner.tsx`, `CreateOutfitModal.tsx`)
- [p] The system assists users in finding matching clothing items (e.g., pairing a blouse with a specific skirt). (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py` or `recommendations.py`, Frontend: `OutfitGenerator.tsx`, `AIOutfitAnalyzer.tsx` - could be AI-driven or simpler logic)
- [x] Users can schedule outfits for specific dates and events (calendar integration). (Backend: `weekly_plans.py`, `outfits.py`, Frontend: `PlanWeekModal.tsx`, `SavedWeeklyPlans.tsx`, `OccasionPlanner.tsx`)
- [p] Users can create virtual outfit previews. (Frontend: `WardrobePreview.tsx` - extent of "virtual preview" is unclear, could be simple image composition)
- [x] Users can save created outfits. (Backend: `outfits.py`, Frontend: `CreateOutfitModal.tsx`)

### AI-Powered Recommendations

- [x] The system suggests outfit combinations based on available wardrobe items. (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py`, `recommendations.py`, Frontend: `AIOutfitAnalyzer.tsx`, `OutfitGenerator.tsx`)
- [x] The system provides AI-powered outfit recommendations. (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py`, `recommendations.py`, Frontend: `AIOutfitAnalyzer.tsx`)
- [p] Recommendations are tailored to user's personal style preferences. (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py`, `style_history.py`, Frontend: `AIStyleInsights.tsx` - depends on depth of preference tracking)
- [ ] Not Implemented - Recommendations consider weather conditions. (No specific component or router listed for weather integration)
- [x] Recommendations are event-based (e.g., weddings, church, casual). (Backend: `occasions.py`, `ai_analyzer.py`, Frontend: `AIEventRecommender.tsx`)
- [x] The system uses an intelligent matching algorithm for compatible clothing items (based on color, style, occasion). (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py`, Frontend: `AIOutfitAnalyzer.tsx`)
- [x] The system offers personalized outfit suggestions based on user preferences. (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py`, `style_history.py`, `recommendations.py`, Frontend: `AIStyleInsights.tsx`, `AIOutfitAnalyzer.tsx`)
- [x] Machine learning models analyze clothing combinations and suggest fashion trends. (Backend: `ai_analyzer.py`, Frontend: `AITrendForecasting.tsx`)

### Community Features
- [x] Users can share outfit ideas. (Frontend: `CommunityHub.tsx`, `CommunityFeed.tsx`. Backend: Implied via `outfits.py` or a dedicated community router)
- [x] Users can engage with a fashion-minded community. (Frontend: `CommunityContainer.tsx`, `CommunityHub.tsx`, `StyleCommunities.tsx`)
- [p] Users can receive feedback on shared outfits. (Frontend: `CommunityFeed.tsx` likely supports this. Backend: Needs mechanism to store/retrieve feedback, possibly linked to outfits or a community model)
- [p] Users who share outfit ideas with friends are more likely to become frequent app users (Hypothesis to be validated by feature, implies sharing with friends). (Frontend: `CommunityHub.tsx` might have friend-sharing options, but not explicit)
- [p] Receiving feedback on shared outfits will increase user engagement and satisfaction (Hypothesis to be validated by feature). (Covered by feedback feature above)

### User Profile and History
- [x] Users have personal accounts. (Backend: `auth.py`, Frontend: `UserProfile.tsx`)
- [p] The system stores user preferences. (Backend: `auth.py` or dedicated user profile table, Frontend: `UserProfile.tsx` - depth of preferences unclear)
- [x] The system tracks user wardrobe habits. (Backend: `statistics.py`, `wardrobe.py`, Frontend: `WardrobeStats.tsx`)
- [x] The system tracks outfit history. (Backend: `style_history.py` (could be outfit history or broader style trends), `outfits.py` (implies history by storing outfits), Frontend: `StyleHistory.tsx`)
- [x] The system uses data analytics to provide users with insights into their wardrobe usage patterns. (Backend: `statistics.py`, Frontend: `WardrobeStats.tsx`, `AIStyleInsights.tsx`)

### Sustainability Features
- [p] The system encourages mindful fashion choices. (Partially through `WardrobeStats.tsx` and `AIStyleInsights.tsx` - indirect encouragement)
- [x] The system provides analytics on underused clothing items. (Backend: `statistics.py`, Frontend: `WardrobeStats.tsx`)
- [p] The system promotes sustainable clothing practices. (Partially through analytics and insights - indirect promotion)
- [x] Tracking wardrobe usage encourages users to wear a broader variety of their clothing. (Supported by `statistics.py` and `WardrobeStats.tsx`)

### General & Technical
- [p] The application is an intuitive and user-friendly mobile and web-based application. (Subjective; assumed goal of listed UI components and general structure)
- [p] The system includes an intuitive interface and seamless navigation. (Subjective; assumed goal of listed UI components)
- [ ] Not Implemented - The system allows virtual try-ons (mentioned as a potential AR feature to explore). (`WardrobePreview.tsx` is likely simpler than AR try-on)
- [ ] Not Implemented - The system provides notifications reminding users of planned outfits. (No specific components for notifications listed)
- [ ] Not Implemented - The system implements gamification elements (e.g., badges for creative outfit combinations) to increase user engagement (Hypothesis, implies feature).
- [p] Data privacy and security measures are implemented to protect user data. (Backend: `auth.py` for authentication is a start; full scope of data security is broad)
- [p] The app complies with relevant data protection regulations and standards. (Depends on implementation details beyond component list, e.g., how data is stored, consent mechanisms)
